This repository was made as I studied for the AWS-CLF C01 test, also known as the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam (CLF-C01), which is required to receive a credential. Taking notes was challenging because I was learning from the course. Since no PDF of the slides was provided, I made my own. These PDFs can be used by as many students who have the same issue to hasten their learning and complete the course. Because, let's face it, completing a 13-hour course is no small feat.
